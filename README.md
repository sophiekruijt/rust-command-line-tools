# Rust Command Line Tools

Welcome to my personal learning project in Rust! In this project, I aim to reimplement basic command line utilities like ls, mkdir, and more, using the Rust programming language. This project serves as a hands-on exploration of Rust's features, including its focus on performance, memory safety, and concurrency.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sophiekruijt/rust-command-line-tools.git
